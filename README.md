# Portfolio Website
This site will serve as my, Stephen Emery's, portfolio site while I'm studying at Epicodus.
## Features
The site is responsive in a few ways. The picture and text will shrink as the screen size gets smaller. The columns will also line up on top of each other on smaller screen sizes. There are also hover links added to social media icons on the bottom.
## Usage
To view the site, you can go to [mehequanna.github.io/portfolio](mehequanna.github.io/portfolio).
To use the code, you can clone the repository at [https://github.com/Mehequanna/portfolio](https://github.com/Mehequanna/portfolio).
After cloning the repository, open the index.html into a web browser of your choice.
